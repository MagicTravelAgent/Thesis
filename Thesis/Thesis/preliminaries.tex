\chapter{Preliminaries}\label{preliminaries}
This is an optional chapter that contains knowledge that your reader needs to know in order to understand
your work. If there is not much you can also embed the preliminaries in one of the other chapters or even discard it completely. 
Your thesis audience consists of your fellow third year Artificial Intelligence bachelor students who have done the same courses as you have, but not necessarily the same electives.
