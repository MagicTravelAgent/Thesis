\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}
The introduction of your bachelor thesis introduces the research area, the research hypothesis, and the scientific contributions of your work.
Simon Peyton Jones, a researcher at Microsoft Research, gives seven tips on how to write a great research paper which might be worth looking at
\cite{peyton_2016:HowToWriteAGreatResearchPaper}.

The following things are usually in an introduction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the problem and state the research question;
\item Motivate why this problem must be solved;
\item demonstrate that a (new) solution is needed;
\item Explain the intuition behind your solution;
\item Motivate why / how your solution solves the problem (this is technical);
\item Explain briefly how it compares with related work.
\end{itemize}

The introduction is closed with a paragraph in which the content in the next chapters is briefly mentioned to give an overview. A guideline is one sentence per chapter.
