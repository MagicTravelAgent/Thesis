# Thesis
The GitHub repository for all the code used within the thesis of Lucas Puddifoot

Within the folder "Thesis" the main code to run the experiment is titled "main.py". In addition to this the graphing scripts can also be found there, as well as all of the data collected over the course of the project. Furthermore, several files can be found containing legacy code that detail the evolution of my final experiment. Finally, screenshots of earlier experiments that did not make it into the final project are also contained within the folder.
